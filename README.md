<strong> Required User Stories:</strong> <br> <br>
<li>The application must allow the user to add a car to the current inventory.</li>
<li>The application must allow the user to add a car to delete a car from the inventory.
<li>The application must show/list all cars in the current inventory.
<li>The application must allow the user to search for cars by:
<ol>
<li>Make</li>
